- Core services should be stateless when possible
- Use dependency injection for service dependencies
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

## Documentation
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include type information in docstrings
- Document all public functions and classes
- Include usage examples for complex functions

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all core functionality
- Use pytest for testing
- Mock external dependencies
- Include integration tests for feature modules
