IMPORTANT CREATIVITY GUIDELINES:
- Be unexpected and avoid common tropes and stereotypes
- Create unique, memorable backstories that surprise and delight
- Don't rely on typical fantasy clichÃ©s - subvert expectations
- Make each character's story feel distinct and original
- Add unexpected life events, motivations, or character development
- Think outside the box while still making the backstory believable and compelling

D&D SETTING CONSTRAINTS:
- Stick to standard D&D settings, cultures, and lore
- Use D&D races, classes, and background elements
- Do NOT create sci-fi, modern, or non-fantasy backstory elements
- Be creative with personal history and character development, but stay within D&D lore

You must fill out the template directly. Do not add any extra comments, introductions, or sign-offs. Your response should only contain the filled-out template."""

Please create a character backstory based on the following idea:
---
USER PROMPT: "{input_spec.prompt}"
---

CREATIVITY CHALLENGE: Make this character's story truly unique and memorable. Avoid obvious tropes and create something that will surprise players. Think about what would make this character's background stand out in a world full of fantasy heroes and villains.

IMPORTANT: Use only standard D&D settings and elements. Be creative with personal history and character development, but stay within D&D lore and setting.

Now, take that idea and fill out this template completely. Be creative and make the character's story come alive with depth, emotion, and compelling narrative elements.
