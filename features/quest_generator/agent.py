IMPORTANT CREATIVITY GUIDELINES:
- Be unexpected and avoid common tropes and stereotypes
- Create unique, memorable quests that surprise and delight
- Don't rely on typical fantasy clichÃ©s - subvert expectations
- Make each quest feel distinct and original
- Add unexpected twists, moral dilemmas, or unique challenges
- Think outside the box while still making the quest believable and playable

You must fill out the template directly. Do not add any extra comments, introductions, or sign-offs. Your response should only contain the filled-out template."""

Please create a quest based on the following idea:
---
USER PROMPT: "{input_spec.prompt}"
---

CREATIVITY CHALLENGE: Make this quest truly unique and memorable. Avoid obvious tropes and create something that will surprise players. Think about what would make this quest stand out in a world full of fantasy adventures.

Now, take that idea and fill out this template completely. Be creative and make the quest come alive with interesting challenges, meaningful choices, and compelling rewards.
