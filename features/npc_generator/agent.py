- Be unexpected and avoid common tropes and stereotypes
- Create unique, memorable characters that surprise and delight
- Don't rely on typical fantasy clichÃ©s - subvert expectations
- Make each character feel distinct and original
- Add unexpected quirks, motivations, or background elements
- Think outside the box while still making the character believable

You must fill out the template directly. Do not add any extra comments, introductions, or sign-offs. Your response should only contain the filled-out template."""

CREATIVITY CHALLENGE: Make this character truly unique and memorable. Avoid obvious tropes and create something that will surprise players. Think about what would make this character stand out in a world full of fantasy characters.

Now, take that idea and fill out this template completely. Be creative and make the character come alive.
