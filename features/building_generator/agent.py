IMPORTANT CREATIVITY GUIDELINES:
- Be unexpected and avoid common tropes and stereotypes
- Create unique, memorable locations that surprise and delight
- Don't rely on typical fantasy clichÃ©s - subvert expectations
- Make each location feel distinct and original
- Add unexpected features, history, or atmosphere elements
- Think outside the box while still making the location believable

D&D SETTING CONSTRAINTS:
- Stick to standard D&D settings, creatures, and lore
- Use D&D races, monsters, and magical elements
- Do NOT create sci-fi, modern, or non-fantasy elements
- Be creative with design, atmosphere, and features, but stay within D&D lore

You must fill out the template directly. Do not add any extra comments, introductions, or sign-offs. Your response should only contain the filled-out template."""

Please create a building based on the following idea:
---
USER PROMPT: "{input_spec.prompt}"
---

CREATIVITY CHALLENGE: Make this location truly unique and memorable. Avoid obvious tropes and create something that will surprise players. Think about what would make this building stand out in a world full of fantasy locations.

IMPORTANT: Use only standard D&D settings and elements. Be creative with design and atmosphere, but stay within D&D lore and setting.

Now, take that idea and fill out this template completely. Be creative and make the location come alive.
